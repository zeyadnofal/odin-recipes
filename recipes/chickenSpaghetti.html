    <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F5346147.jpg&w=596&h=399&c=sc&poi=face&q=60">
    <p>No canned soups were harmed in the making of this chicken spaghetti recipe, which showcases a whole bird.</p><p>Other than requiring a little time, this recipe is dead simple. Just be sure to undercook your pasta by at least a minute, since it'll finish cooking in hot sauce for a few more minutes.</p> <p>This is a critical step, and allows all those flavors to get sucked up by the still hydrating spaghetti. Garnish with a little more Pecorino Romano cheese and basil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4.5 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>2 anchovy fillets</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced basil leaves</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cold butter (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in a pot and pour marinara sauce on top. Add water and anchovies. Bring to a simmer, uncovered, over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, without stirring, for 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a bowl using tongs. Let cool to the touch.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring sauce to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, skimming off the fat from the surface, until sauce is reduced by at least half, 20 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Tear off chicken meat by hand and transfer to a bowl, breaking the pieces into your desired size.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken, red pepper flakes, and salt to the reduced sauce. Cook and stir until chicken is heated through, about 2 minutes. Keep on low heat while you cook the pasta.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water according to package instructions, reducing time by 1 minute, about 11 minutes. Drain and return to the pot; reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken sauce and Pecorino Romano to the pasta. Sprinkle in basil and add butter. Stir until butter melts, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat and add remaining Pecorino Romano cheese. Cover and let sit for 1 minute. Stir and serve.</li>
    </ol>
