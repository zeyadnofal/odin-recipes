    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 (8 ounce) rib-eye steak</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Two days before cooking, salt both sides of each steak with 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt per steak.
            Place steaks in an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to cook.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steak with
            black pepper.
        </li>

        <li>Heat cast iron pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil and heat until oil shimmers.</li>

        <li>Carefully place steaks in pan. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>
            Turn steaks and top with one teaspoon butter. Cook for 3 to 4 more minutes or to desired doneness. You may need
            to cook the steaks in batches depending on the size of your cast iron pan. Keep the cooked steaks in a 170
            degree F oven until ready to serve.
        </li>
